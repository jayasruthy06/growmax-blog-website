While many businesses can technically be considered enterprises, not all require an enterprise-level eCommerce platform. Such a platform becomes essential when a company manages diverse product or service offerings, consolidates financial and technical resources across branches, operates with dedicated teams across various departments like marketing and sales, and has an established global presence. These characteristics indicate a level of complexity and scale that necessitates the robust capabilities of an enterprise eCommerce solution."

It is important to engage with vendors early and request demos demonstrating how their software works across these models. B2B transactions typically involve longer sales cycles, the need for managed company accounts, and require more communication between buyer and seller before orders are finalized. In contrast, B2C and D2C models have faster purchase processes and rely less on communication. Many B2C platforms lack essential features needed for long-term B2B relationships, such as corporate accounts, quotation requests, split shipping, multi-tier user access, and integration with customer relationship management systems."

Software as a Service (SaaS) offers web-based access with vendor-hosted infrastructure and low startup costs, making it easy to maintain and access from any device. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides customizable virtual hardware resources that clients manage themselves, offering scalability but requiring more setup time and technical expertise. Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides an environment for deploying applications while the provider manages hosting and core services; it supports rapid testing and deployment but may have scalability limitations and platform dependencies."

Many organizations underestimate these cumulative costs, which can significantly impact the success of adopting a new platform.
