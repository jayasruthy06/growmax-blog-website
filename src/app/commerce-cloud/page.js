While basic functionalities may be enough to get started, over time, it becomes essential to streamline the sales and service process for both your business and your customers. These additional capabilities can significantly simplify your operations and support a seamless sales journey from start to finish. Your online B2B store should provide an integrated panel that allows users to sign in and manage their accounts with ease. It should support multiple languages and currencies to facilitate global operations. A sales cart feature is crucial to help users manage their purchase lists efficiently. Reordering complicated past orders should be simple and straightforward. The platform should also be capable of managing a broad inventory, catering to the diverse needs of customers. A well-structured product panel should help define whether items are sold individually or in packs. Furthermore, the platform should allow for the creation of customized price lists tailored to specific customers or customer groups. Advanced ordering features should include the ability to split product deliveries to multiple addresses and set different delivery dates. The order history must be clearly recorded and accessible within a single interface. Multiple secure payment options such as credit/debit cards, e-wallets, and contract-based payments should be supported to accommodate customers worldwide."
