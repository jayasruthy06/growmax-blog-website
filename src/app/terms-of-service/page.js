        <h3 className={styles.legalHeading}>Subscriptions</h3>
        <p className={styles.legalPassage}>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.<br/>
        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Apptino Software Private Limited cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Apptino Software Private Limited customer support team.<br/>
        A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Apptino Software Private Limited with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Apptino Software Private Limited to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.<br/>
        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Apptino Software Private Limited will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

        Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
